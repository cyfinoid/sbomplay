## SingleRepo.html

I have got feedback where people want to be able to look at just one repository.

I want to create a page singlerepo.html that would do all what we are doing but for a single repository. 

1. user will provide a github url for its application
2. We will query the dependencygraph : if its not present we will raise an alert otherwise we proceed as we do.
3. we perform the license analysis
4. we perform dependency vulnerability analysis
5. we perform transitive dependency analysis.
