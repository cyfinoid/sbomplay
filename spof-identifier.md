# Single Point of Failure Identification.

I want to look at all the packages and their transitive dependencies and create a list of authors that are responsible for these packages. What I am looking for is authors that are the core for our repository. if there is one author which constitutes the bulk of contribution to my repository i should be keeping a tab on that author.
